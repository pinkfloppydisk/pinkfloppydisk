This is going to be my second attempt in trying out Obsidian for a week. I've already done this before but failed because of how overwhelming this software is for beginners. I still don't think it would replace my my love for Notion. Sync for mobile and desktop is still not available unless you paid for their subscription fee which is $5/month or $48/ year according to their [website](https://obsidian.md/sync)

Writing here is fast same with Craft. Notion still needs that native writing feeling. Notion is not seamless for writers but it's a really great tool! Close to perfect if they support offline mode and end-to-end encryption. 

I am still waiting for the day for Obsidian to release an accessible way to sync across your devices. For now, it's a bit technical and I don't understand git.
