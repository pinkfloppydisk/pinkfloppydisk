Obsidian is really easy to understand. Given I have to use it in a week to know it's ins and out, I've already installed some of the major add-ons to make my Obsidian experience more efficient on [Day 4](https://pinkfloppydisk.github.io//2021/community-driven-tools/). I didn't want to complicate Obsidian because I don't write a lot of words, I don't have a lot of essays to turn this into a [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/). Writing something is already complicated and having this system of sync and relating to's just won't work for a minimalist mind like mine. I was able to use Obsidian for a weekâ€”but not extensively. 

Obsidian is a really great tool for writers and people who want to write. Like I said, it is very smooth and simple.
