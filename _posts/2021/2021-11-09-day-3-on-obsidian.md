I think this is an awesome writing software. It's fast but I can really use it for my every day tasks. I watched a lot of Obsidian videos recently and its users really try to make it into something it's not. Sure, you can make a lot of things out of it since it's open source but why try to make everything so complicated? I now have a love/hate relationship with Obsidian. Craft on the other hand is a great Native Mac app but the lack of diversity in its preferences just makes it another note taking tool. The left menu panel is just too simple and once you open the app, you see everything which makes it overwhelming and not private.

I'm on Day 3 discovering Obsidian and I think I've tweaked everything on the app as I likeâ€”simple, minimal and useful.
