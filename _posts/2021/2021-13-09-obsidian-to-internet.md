Testing some posts written from Obsidian as part of my 1 Week of Obsidian. I think this is the easy way of writing down Markdown to your website, especially static sites that supports markdown. Jekyll and Markdown is absolutely efficient and accessible to me as when I write this from Obsidian it goes straight to VSCode (my code editor of choice) and with just a little bit of git magic. It goes live. Fantastic, no?
