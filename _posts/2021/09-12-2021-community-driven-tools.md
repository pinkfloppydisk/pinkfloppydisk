I think I've installed the essential Obsidian plugins for "beginners". I'm on Day 4 and I'm still discovering a lot of useful plugins to make your Obsidian experience great. I still think that Obsidian is just another note-taking app but open source and other users can contribute in creating features in to the app. It's more like building in public but for Obsidian and its users. 

It's amazing to me that Obsidian has this amazing community that contributes to the app almost everydayâ€”very dedicated users that really makes the Obsidian experience easy. I wish every app has to be like this. I am part of the Notion community as well and would always contribute templates to the users. Even developers contribute to Notion by adding some add-on to your browser. 

Users are very dedicated to your app/software when you care about them too. You don't just put out something out there and just leave your decision within the company. You also have to hear your users with what they want because they are the ones who can evaluate your performance outside the company and also user experience is key in making your app functional.
